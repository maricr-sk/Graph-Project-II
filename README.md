# Graph-Project-II
Very in-depth code using adjacency matrices, graphs (hashmaps and hashsets), BFS, DFS, and Priority Queues for ordered and unordered graphs, as well as implementing functions like finding the edges, number of edges, order, and searching the shortest distance between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. 

Directions: 

Use the following input file (which contains a list of edges) to create a graph. Then do a BFS starting at node C. Also do a DFS starting at node C. Be sure to do the BFS search and generate its output before doing the DFS search. when you have a choice of visiting more than one node, visit them in alphabetical order.


your program should print the results for each search on a single line with a single space separating each node listed. for example, for your BFS and DFS searches, your output might look like this:


CABDEHIG

CDABHEGI

in the input file, the first number will indicate the number of trials. the second number will indicate the number of nodes for the current trial. the third number will indicate how many edges are in the current trial. what will follow will be a pair of nodes for each edge in the trial.
